CSS SELECTORS & INHERITANCE 

CSS selectors : used to select HTML elements which we want to style.

Types:

>>> Simple Selectors:
   		>> Class Selector
   		>> ID Selector
   		>> Type(tag name)Selector
   		   Universal Selector
   		   Attribute Selector
   		   Pseudo-class
>>> Compound Selectors
>>> Complex Selectors
				many more ...



ID selector : The CSS ID Selector selects an HTML element based on its id attribute value
It consists of a hash(#), followed by the ID of the element.

Note:There should be only one HTML element with a given id in the entire document

      #idname{
      }
        property1:value1;
        property2:value2;

Type(tag name)Selector:

Selects all the HTML elements within the document based on their tag names(h1,p,div,etc.)

h1{
	font-size:28px;
	color:orange;
  	font-weight:600; 
}

p {
	color:blue;
}

>>> In CSS,the styles that are applied to HTML elements depend on three fundamental concepts
 	Inheritance
      Specificity
 	Cascade
 
Inheritance: Some of the CSS Property values set on the Parent Elements are received
   		(inherited)by their Child Elements 

CSS properties can be categorized into two types:
							Inherited properties
							Non-inherited properties

>>> Inherited Properties:

	If the CSS properties applied to the parent element are inherited by the child elements, then they are called Inherited properties.

Some of the CSS Inherited Properties are:-

	Text related Properties

		font-family
		font-style
		font-weight
		text-align

	List related Properties
	
		list-style-type
		color property and many more.

>>> Non-inherited Properties :

	If the CSS properties applied to the parent element are not inherited by the child elements, then they are called Non-inherited properties.

Some of the CSS Non-inherited properties are:

	CSS Box Properties

		width
		height
		margin
		padding
		border-style
		border-width
		border-color
		border-radius

	CSS Background Properties

		background-image
		background-color
		background-size
		text-decorationand many more.

CSS SPECIFICITY & CASCADE :

>> SPECIFICITY : It is a means by which browser decide the most relevent css property values for an element.       

 A Class Selector is more specific compared to Type (tag name) Selector.

 It selects only the elements that have a specific class attribute value in a HTML 
 document.

 ID selector is even more specific than class selector.
 
 It selects only a single HTML Element in the document since we provide unique IDs to
 the HTML Elements.

INLINE STYLES : Directly applying styles to HTML element.

 <tag style = "property : value1 ; property : value1 ; ....">

 It has the highest specificity among all others.

 Styles applied using inline styles will owerwrite any other styles specified using 
 selectors.

 Using Inline Styles is not recommended because

	Inline Styles are not reusable.
	Writing HTML and CSS separately increases code readability.

CSS Cascade:

 The source order of CSS Rulesets matters. When two CSS Rulesets have equal specificity, 
 the one that comes last in the CSS is applied.

 The styles that apply to the HTML Elements are not determined by the order the classes 
 defined in the HTML class attribute, but instead the order in which they appear in the 
 CSS.

The !important exception :

 It is a special piece of CSS used to make a particular CSS property and value the most 
 specific thing, irrespective of source order and specificity.

 The only way to override a !important property value is to include another !important 
 property value. The added property value should either come later in the order or should 
 be of higher specificity.

 Always look for a way to use specificity before even considering !important.

 Only use !important when you want to override foreign CSS (from external libraries, like 
 Bootstrap).
