BACKEND:  
any information to be stored is data.

DATA has size, occupies space as any physical object occupy space.

HOW TO MEASURE SIZE AND SPACE OCCUPIED BY DATA ?

measured in the units of byte and bytes.

1 BYTE = 8 BITS
1 KBYTE = 1024 BYTES

WHERE IS THE DATA STORED? HOW IS IT UPDATED?
backend

Database: makes it easy to deal with data(information)
		-store
		-organise
		-access
		-update etc.,

USER INTERFACE: user interacts with software through user interface.

API(APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE): application interacts with each other through API.
 
> client communicates with server through API 

CLOUD:
	Refers to
		> Servers that are accessed over the internet
		> The softwares that run on those servers

On-demand availability of server system, of any size, over the internet at the click of a button from your computer

URL: Uniform Resource Locator


browser understands HTML,CSS,JS

syntax: rules of language


BUG & DEBUG:

> anything not exactly to desired outcome it means it has BUG.
> process of fixing the BUG is DEBUGGING.

DEBUGGING checklist:
 
> HTML elements tag name
> HTML elements closed properly or not
> HTML attribute names and values
> CSS property names and values
> image element syntax
> paragraph element syntax
> heading element syntax

TWEAKING the code: 

Making small changes in the code to understand the software behaviour
EX: changing colors, images, texts, etc.

Key Takeaways:
> Browser & URL - Must open any website
> Syntax - Rules of the Language
	~ It's a small part of programming
> Bug & Debugging - Making your code work
	~Second important part of programming
> Tweaking Code - Getting insights of code
